## About Me

I am an architect with a passion for merging innovative architectural design with technology. I graduated from **Izmir Institute of Technology** in 2022 and have since gained valuable experience in both traditional architectural practices and software-based architectural solutions. I have been studying Python and C# for more than one year now.
